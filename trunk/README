Introduction
------------

Vinetto is a forensics tool to examine Thumbs.db files.


License

This program is distributed under the GNU General Public License - see the
accompanying COPYING file for more details.

The vinetto code was written with grateful thanks to:

        Martin Schwartz - Author of Laola and libole2


Project overview
----------------
1 - Context : The Windows systems (98, ME, 2000 and XP) can store thumbnails
and metadata of the picture files contained in the directories of its FAT32 or
NTFS filesystems. 
Thumbnails and associated metadata are stored in Thumbs.db files. 
Thumbs.db files are undocumented OLE structured files.

Once a picture file has been deleted from the filesystem, the related thumbnail
and associated metada remain stored in the Thumbs.db file. So, the data
contained in those thumbs.db files are an helpful source of information for the
forensics investigator.

2 - What the software will do : Vinetto will extract thumbnails and associated
metadata from the Thumbs.db files.
development phase 1 : Thumbnails will be written as JPEG picture files.
Associated metadata will be written in flat text file.
development phase 2 : Vinetto will have a GUI that will display thumbnails.

3 - What purpose it will serve : Vinetto will help *nix-based forensics
investigators to : 
  -> easily preview thumbnails of deleted pictures on Windows systems, 
  -> obtain informations (dates, path, ...) about those deleted images. 

4 - Misc. : Vinetto is intended to be integrated into forensics liveCD like
FCCU GNU/Linux Forensic Boot CD.


Requirements
------------

A little-endian *nix platform : at this stage vinetto doesn't work under
MacOS/PPC.

Python-2.2 or later. Vinetto is primarily developed against python-2.3.

PIL (Python Imaging Library) 1.1.5 or later. PIL is used to attempt correct
reconstitution the Type 1 thumbnails. 


Current limitations
-------------------

AFAIK Windows(R)(TM) uses two types format to store thumbnails in its Thumbs.db
files.
I called these formats Type 1 and Type 2 .
Type 2 is compliant to jpeg format. But Type 1 seems to be an obscure perversion
of jpeg format with special headers, huffman and quantization tables.

*** Currently, vinetto does not manage to reconstitute correctly the Type 1
thumbnails. ***


Usage
-----

Usage: vinetto [-d dir ] file

	file : a Thumbs.db file

	-d dir : specify the location where extracted thumbnails and metadata
list should be written.

	If there is no directory specified, metadata list will be written on
standard output.

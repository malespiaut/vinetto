Project overview [21 mar 2006]
================
1 - Context : The Windows systems (98, ME, 2000 and XP) can store thumbnails
and metadata of the picture files contained in the directories of its FAT32 or
NTFS filesystems. 
Thumbnails and associated metadata are stored in Thumbs.db files. 
Thumbs.db files are undocumented OLE structured files.

Once a picture file has been deleted from the filesystem, the related thumbnail
and associated metada remain stored in the Thumbs.db file. So, the data
contained in those thumbs.db files are an helpful source of information for the
forensics investigator.

2 - What the software will do : Vinetto will extract thumbnails and associated
metadata from the Thumbs.db files.
development phase 1 : Thumbnails will be written as JPEG picture files.
Associated metadata will be written in flat text file.
development phase 2 : Vinetto will have a GUI that will display thumbnails.

3 - What purpose it will serve : Vinetto will help *nix-based forensics
investigators to : 
  -> easily preview thumbnails of deleted pictures on Windows systems, 
  -> obtain informations (dates, path, ...) about those deleted images. 

4 - Misc. : Vinetto is intended to be integrated into forensics liveCD like
FCCU GNU/Linux Forensic Boot CD.


Usage
=====

Usage: vinetto [-d dir ] file

	file : a Thumbs.db file

	-d dir : specify the location where extracted thumbnails and metadata
